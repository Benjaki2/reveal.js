					    ### Innersource Roadblocks

					    * Management not willing to change
					    * Developers not willing to work outside of their group
					    * Silolization of development groups
					    * Groups using different tools (i.e. JIRA vs GitHub Issues)
					    * Having a mix of private & public repositories
					    * Too much to move at once
					    * General fear of change

					</script>

        <section data-markdown>

					    ### Innersource & Culture change

              * Start stealthily. Don't just come out and say "We're changing. Use this tool now"
					    * Make tools available & share common tools (but choose tools for the future)
					    * Let people who have experience with tools champion those tools
					    * Shine a light on teams that use tools effectively
					    * Supportive technical leadership
					    * Focus on code readability (Less documentation, more process)
					    * Remove hierarchical systems
					    * Making decisions more transparent
					    * Physical environment changes. Embrace open spaces.

					    ### Government Open Source

					    * GSA Digital Services Team responsible for code.gov
					    * Overall Goal: Get all 24 agencies to embrace open source
					    * Near Term: Get to 20% of all code being open source
					    * Longer Term: Aggregate all open source projects into code.gov
					    * Biggest Challenges: Building a culture of "open first"
					    * Next Biggest Challenging: Building an inventory of open source code; right now GSA has over 1000+ Github repos
					    * Solution: Leverage the GitHub REST API to determine which repos contain source code
					    * Near Term Goal: Adopt new schemas (Github GraphQl API) to simplify API requests
					    * Long Term Goal: Get to 90% of all code being open source
					    * Big fear from many agencies is accidently submitting secretive code.
					    * How to overcome this? Develop tools to scan code preventatively (using local git hooks) & reactively (using web hooks)

					    ### Mental wellness in development teams

					    * Code Review
					    * This is someones approach to solving a problem
					    * Make opportunities for praise
					    * Keep tone in mind
					    * Ask for devs explanation of this approach
					    * Make development changes first
					    * Don't let issues drag on and become a repetitive problem when they can be solved in a few days (or weeks).

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					    ### New Tools

					    * Dependency monitoring
					    * Github subteams
					    * Github's GraphQL
					    * Heroku CI

					</script>
				</section>
        <section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					    ### Cool Discoveries

					    * October is Hacktober; great time to get new developers involved!
					    * New Atom editor tools: Atom IDE & Atom tree-sitter parsing
					    * Waffle.io burndown/story points
					    * ZenHub. A waffle.io like solution but as a browser extension.

					</script>

        <section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					    ### Other take aways

					    * Big shift to cloud computing. Amazon can't build enough "SnowMobiles" to meet demands
					    * Many people using githooks in some way to prevent private code from being published.
					    * Everyone I talked to embraces Slack & the use of slackbots for management.
					    * No Waffle.io support for GitHub Projects anytime soon.. :(
